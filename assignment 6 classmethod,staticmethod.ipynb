    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. \n",

    "Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). \n",
    "The derived classes inherit the properties and behaviors of the base class, allowing code reuse and the ability to extend or modify\n",
    " the inherited functionality. Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the concept of hierarchical classification.\n",

    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on different forms or have multiple behaviors depending on the context. \n",

    "overriding and method overloading. It enhances flexibility, extensibility, and code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features and hiding unnecessary details. \n",
    "It focuses on providing a clear and concise interface for interacting with objects, while hiding the underlying implementation complexities. \n",
